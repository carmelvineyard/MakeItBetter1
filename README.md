# MakeItBetter1
My first attempt to fix the most hilarious page on the Internet.


First of all, you simply must go [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20130226232047/http://www.sewingandembroiderywarehouse.com/embtrb.htm) to see the most hilarious page on the Internet.

I'm not certain how the thing loads. Mad respect for the Internet Archive saving this wonderous gem of a webpage for us to Make Better now. 

This looks like something I would have seen on Geocities back in the day. Inline styling! HTML Tables everywhere! It's glorious.

In this first attempt, my goal is to make the page as it should have been using modern CSS. In future iterations/ repositories I hope to make it even better/more modern.
